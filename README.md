# Microsoft Purview Demo Setup

This repository provides an automated deployment for a pre-populated Microsoft Purview demo environment. This version includes **fixes for Azure PowerShell module version conflicts** that prevent deployment failures.

## 🔧 Key Improvements

- **Fixed PowerShell Module Conflicts**: Resolved Az.Purview module version compatibility issues
- **REST API Implementation**: Uses Azure Management REST APIs to eliminate module dependencies
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and retry logic for reliable deployment
- **Streamlined Architecture**: Single optimized deployment script
- **Updated Dependencies**: Latest Azure PowerShell version (11.0) for better compatibility

## Prerequisites

* An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
* Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
* Sufficient permissions to create resources and assign RBAC roles
* No Azure Policies blocking Storage accounts or Event Hub namespace creation

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navintkr/purview-demo.git
   cd purview-demo
   ```

2. **Create a resource group**:
   ```bash
   az group create --name "rg-purview-demo" --location "East US"
   ```

3. **Deploy the template**:
   ```bash
   az deployment group create \
     --resource-group "rg-purview-demo" \
     --template-file "templates/template.bicep" \
     --parameters sqlServerAdminPassword="<<your-sql-admin-password-here>>"
   ```

## � Deployment Approach

This implementation uses a **REST API-based PowerShell script** that:
- Avoids Azure PowerShell module version conflicts
- Uses Azure Management REST APIs for Purview operations
- Provides more reliable deployment in Azure deployment script environments
- Includes comprehensive error handling and retry logic

## �📦 Deployed Resources

The deployment creates a complete Purview demo environment including:

- **Microsoft Purview Account** - Data governance and catalog service
- **Azure SQL Database** - With AdventureWorksLT sample data
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** - With sample datasets
- **Azure Data Factory** - Pre-configured pipelines and datasets
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** - Analytics workspace
- **Azure Key Vault** - Secure credential storage
- **Managed Identity** - For secure service-to-service authentication

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Managed Identity Authentication** - No hardcoded credentials
- **Key Vault Integration** - Secure credential management
- **RBAC Assignments** - Least privilege access controls
- **Network Security** - Proper firewall configurations

## ⏱️ Deployment Time

- **Infrastructure**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Post-deployment scripts**: ~10-15 minutes
- **Data scanning & pipeline**: Additional 10-15 minutes

## 🔍 Validation

After deployment, verify the setup by:

1. Navigate to your Purview account: `https://[your-purview-account].purview.azure.com`
2. Check **Data Map** for collections and data sources
3. Verify **Data Catalog** for discovered assets
4. Review **Management** > **Role assignments** for proper permissions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check deployment logs** in the Azure Portal under Resource Group > Deployments
2. **Review script execution** logs in the deployment script resource
3. **Verify permissions** - ensure your account has Owner or Contributor + User Access Administrator roles
4. **Check service availability** in your selected region
